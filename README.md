# Valorant Gun Skins Tier List
## Valorant has been through a lot of changes since its release. This year, devs have finally released a new addition to the arsenal, the Outlaw. But the question I've been asking myself is, is it better than the other guns? I made a tier list ranking all guns from 1-18.
## 18. Shorty
### As a Reyna Main, I rarely use the shorty since I always ego peek (to peek enemies alone) and I don't like waiting for enemies in short range spots but this gun is very handy when using an operator in the case of whiffing.
